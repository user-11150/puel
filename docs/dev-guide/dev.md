# Development workflow

## Development cycle

!!! tip
    BEFORE 2.1.0, THIS SET OF STANDARDS IS NOT USED BY UEL

To clarify terminology, UEL uses a "major.minor.micro" to nomenclature for production-ready releases. So for UEL 2.1.3, that is a major version of 2, a minor version of 1, and a micro version of 3.

- `major`: new major versions are exceptional; they only come when strongly incompatible changes are deemed necessary, and are planned very long in advance;
- `minor`: new minor versions are feature releases; they get released 3 months.
- `micro`: new micro versions are bugfix releases. They get released time is unstable

We also publish non-final releases witch an additional qualifier: "dev", "alpha", "beta" and "rc"

- "dev": equality development
