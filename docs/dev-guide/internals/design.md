## Abstract {#abstract}
This documentation including design about UEL. It's non-including implementations

## UEL Directory Structure {#directory-structure}

There are serveral top-level directories in UEL. Knowing what each one is meant
to hold will help you find where a certain piece of functionality is implemented.
Do realize, though, there are always exceptions to every rule.

- `.github`
    
    contains github configuration
    
    for example
    
    Github Actions, ISSUE TEMPLATE, ...
    
- `grammar`
