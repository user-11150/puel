# UEL's information
## UEL's information
UEL is UEL's developers to develop programming language

## What about UEL?
* Strong type
* Dynamic type

## What language to develop UEL?
The first. Developers using Python to develop UEL. After, Developers using some
Python extensions, Developers to develop UEL with Python, Cython, and C/C++, Now, We
temporarily deprecated C++, Because c can most of UEL's work, Not using C++
for now, But if some parts of C can't do it or are too complicated, consider using C++

## What performance of UEL?
The UEL's running performance maybe very low now, But we are planning on the
optimizer, and JIT, We believe that one day UEL will perform faster than C/C++.
Because we have a big plan, Runtime Analysis bytecode and optimize the codes
of dynamic. __We trust the UEL's performance will faster than C/C++ on future!__
