## What's UEL?

UEL is a easy to learn, powerful programming language. It has efficient
high-level data structures and a simple but effective approach to object
-oriented programming. UELâ€™s elegant syntax and dynamic typing, together
with its interpreted nature, make it an ideal language for scripting and
rapid application development in many areas on most platforms.

UEL's is freely available and Open Source in Github.

This tutorial introduces the reader informally to the basic concepts and features of the UEL language and system. It helps to have a UEL interpreter handy for hands-on experience, but all examples are self-contained, so the tutorial can be read off-line as well.
