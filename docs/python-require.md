# Python Version Require

__UEL does not support all versions, implementations of Python__

## Requires

1. __Implementation must be CPython__
    
    Because now UEL including some CPython only extensions
    
2. __Version must be upper 3.10__
    
    !!! tip
        Currently, CPython implementations lower 3.10(no all) is can to running
        UEL, but it is unstable.
