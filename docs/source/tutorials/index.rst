**********************
  The UEL Tutorial
**********************

UEL is an easy to learn, powerful programming language. It has efficient
high-level data structures and a simple but effective approach to
object-oriented programming. UEL's elegant syntax and dynamic typing,
together with its interpreted nature, make it an ideal language for scripting
and rapid application development in many areas on most platforms.

The UEL interpreter and the extensive standard library are freely available
in source or binary form for all major platforms from the PyPI,
https://www.pypi.org/project/uel, and may be freely distributed. The same site also
contains distributions of and pointers to many free third party UEL modules,
programs and tools, and additional documentation.

This tutorial does not attempt to be comprehensive and cover every single
feature, or even every commonly used feature. Instead, it introduces many of
UEL's most noteworthy features, and will give you a good idea of the
language's flavor and style. After reading it, you will be able to read and
write UEL modules and programs

The :ref:`glossary` is also worth going through.
