# Abstract
The repeat is a keyword and a statement. It's a Loop statement. It is a loop statement that cannot be broken at the code level alone. At present, because it is in the development stage, there will be a better solution in the future.
# How use it?
It's very simple.
```
repeat
  ...
[END]
```
e.g.
```uel
repeat
  PUT 5
END
```
