on most platforms.

The UEL interpreter and the extensive standard library are freely available in
source or binary form for all major platforms from the PyPI,
https://pypi.org/project/uel/, and may be freely distributed. 

The UEL interpreter is easily extended with new functions and data types
UEL is also suitable as an extension language for customizable applications.
